1. The program consists of 4 files. 
2. The "demand.txt" file is to specify the demand of cities and can be edited. 
3. The "map.txt" file is used to implement map in the program. It is supposed to not edit and if the time comes we can add cities through this file.
4. The "solution.txt" file gives output. Each line shows the path and unloading data of one particular truck. The figure in a bracket alongside city is a drop of that particular city.
5. Now "transportation.exe" is main file doing all computations.

Steps to use:
a. Go in "deamand.txt" to add a demand. Currently, there are only 17 cities in map. You add requirement in front of the city name. Now city name is case sensitive.
b. After that just click on "transportation.exe" and outcome will be generated.
